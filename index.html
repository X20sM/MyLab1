    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
    <p>
      The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia
      and North America. In North America, the populations of brown bears are
      called grizzly bears, while the subspecies that inhabits the Kodiak
      Islands of Alaska is known as the Kodiak bear. It is one of the largest
      living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by
      its closest relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less
      variable in size and slightly bigger on average. The brown bear's range
      includes parts of Russia, Central Asia, the Himalayas, China, Canada, the
      United States, Hokkaido, Scandinavia, Finland, the Balkans, the Picos de
      Europa and the Carpathian region (especially Romania), Iran, Anatolia, and
      the Caucasus. The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal
      in several European countries.
